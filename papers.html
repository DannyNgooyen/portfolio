        <h3>Privacy Policy, Law, and Technology Paper</h3>
        <p>
          This was a collaborative research paper reporting both the objective accuracy of the data on Google profiles and the subjective perception of the users. 
          This research project was funded through a small university grant and followed proper research ethical guidelines. 
          This experience was a great learning opportunity into the care put for academic research.
          Key results show high levels of accuracy for demographic data with more varying accuracy for ad marketing data.
          Many users both simaltaneously believe that the data collected for personalized ads is concerning for privacy, but also relevant to their interests.
          Overall, this result highlights the common "Privacy Paradox" trend shown in other user behavior studies.

        <h3>Privacy Policy Text Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          This was an independent project focusing on text analysis of privacy policies on the basis of their readability. 
          Readability was determined by how easy it is to comprehend the text based on the Flesch Ease score.
          Key findings included an overwhelming number of difficult privacy policies compared to easier ones and the difference in language used.
          Easier privacy policies typically use more direct pronouns to refer to people and used simple action words to refer to choices.
          Harder privacy policies typically used numerous and varied legal terms to refer to people or ideas.
          The results could be used to design better privacy policies for the public, as it is intended.

        <h3>High School AP Research: Privacy Paper</h3>
        <p>My first independent research project, and the first draft of my never-ending passion for privacy.
          The purpose of my research was to determine attitudes regarding online privacy from students and faculty at my high school.
          The results demonstrated a general concern for privacy yet limitations taken to protect privacy beyond strong passwords such as web extensions or VPNs.
          This paper was very amateur and could use a lot of improvement, but it highlights the important starting point that I had with my passion for privacy and research skills.
          It was a formative experience for me and deserves that acknowledgement here.

        <h3>Data Property Rights</h3>
        <p>This was an argumentative paper in favor of data property rights, which I still personally struggle with fully supporting.
           My motivation for writing this was to challenge how far I would support data proprty rights.
           They do represent something tangible for people to gain, and it would lead to a greater acknowledgement of privacy.
           Additionally, it allows of economic empowerment, which is only becoming a bigger issue in modern times.
           It would be challenge to implement, but this paper does explore some possible avenues.

        <h3>Political Philosophy: Critique of Paternalism</h3>
        <p>A messy argument done against Paternalism. 
          This paper perfectly represents my love for privacy through disdain for authority.
          It argues that a paternal state requires some surveillance to determine "what's best".
          Surveillance itself alters behaviors, and people deserve privacy to preserve behaviors under freedom.
          Paternalism still allows for freedom and choices, but the state has undue influence over them.
          Despite its many flaws, I proudly think this paper represents something special to me.

        <h3>Musashi and Better Masculinity</h3>
        <p>This was a really unique paper that what I've written before. It is a social analysis of the manga, "Vagabond". 
          It explores how Musashi and many of the other male characters struggle to understand strength and emotion. 
          Throughout the narrative, Musashi undergoes a path of violence and engages with men of the same mindset.
          The paper explores the core themes of how Musashi is able to grow beyond this initial state into a more introspective and kind man.
          Definitely not my best work, but I enjoyed writing about something different here.
