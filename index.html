        <div class="papers-col">
            <h3> Google's Tracking Accuracy </h3>
            <p> A collaborative research effort to determine accuracy of Google's profile tracking and user perceptions.
                I created some of sections of the survey, and did half of the statistical analysis.
                Long story short, Google is overall highly accurate. People do care about privacy, but not enought to change habits. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="papers-col">
            <h3> Privacy Policies are Failures </h3>
            <p> An independent research project using text analysis techniques to determine readbility of privacy policies. 
                Privacy policies are graded using the Flesch Ease score to rate policies as easy vs hard.
                The results showed actionable changes could be made to the language of privacy policies to make them easier to read such as using direct language.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="papers-col">
            <h3> A Critique of Paternalism </h3>
            <p>A messy argument done for a political philosophy paper. 
               Despite its many flaws, this paper perfectly represents my love for privacy through disdain for authority.
               It argues that a paternal state requires some surveillance to determine "what's best".
               Surveillance itself alters behaviors, and people deserve privacy to preserve behaviors under freedom.

            <h3>112 Term Project</h3>
            <p>First major independent Python Project.
               A game about relationships and uses Tarjan's algorithm to determine grouping.
               A fairly simple UI was developed that embodies the simpler time of my education then.

            <h3>Stonk Project</h3>
            <p>Long-term Python project for experimenting with machine learning models. 
                The stock market is the most well-kept and updated data in the world.
                It has a lot of its own theories and models, so it's fun to play around with and learn.

            <p>Currently working on a scoring algorithm for the non-profit, TCUS. 
               It's a voluntary project that focuses on using machine learning models to determine urgency of social impact projects, notably enviromental.
