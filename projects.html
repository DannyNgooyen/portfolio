            <h1>112 Project</h1>
            <p> In my first major project for CMU's 15-112 course, I tried to create a Python game that combines strategic decision-making with social dynamics. 
                It's a turn-based game where the player can make decisions, affecting their karma score and relationships. 
                The goal is to make as many relationships as possible that are similar to your karma score in a set amount of days. 
                The mechanics itself are simple, but the complexity comes from implementing Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components algorithm. 
                This algorithm is meant to keep track of the mentioned relationships and dynamically adjust throughout rounds to determine the player's success. 
                One of the major focuses was ensuring a clean and simple user interface for ease of play. </p>

            <p>This is my ongoing playground for experimenting with different machine 
                learning techniques and statistical models. I chose stocks as they seem to be the most well-maintained and researched dataset of all time.
               The main results so far have been a prediction model based on statistical testing on simulated datasets. 
               The specific simulation uses Geometric Brownian Motion and Jump Diffusion, which both incorporate historical stock data with some assumptions about stock volatility and drift. 
               A sample of an example stock simulation dataset is shown on the right.
               While this was a fun start, there are still many other potential ideas to explore to better understand market trends. 
               Future plans will involve experimenting with some text analysis on news headlines, using CNN's Greed/Fear Index, and trying out Perceptron.
